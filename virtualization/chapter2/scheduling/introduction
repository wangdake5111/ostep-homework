1.
                        SJF                         FIFO
response time           (0+200+400)/3=200           200
turnaround time         (200+400+600)/3=400         400

2. 
response time           (0+100+300)/3 = 133         133
turnaround time         (100+300+600)/3 = 333       333

3.
                        RR(with 1)
response time           (0+1+2)/3 = 1
turnaround time         (598+599+600)/3 = 599

4. arrive at the same time and the order is the short first
5. type is that the order of the jobs is that the short first, if the quantum is larger than all of the length of the jobs, they will be equal.
6. increase with the length
7. increase with the quantum, when the quantum is larger than the length of the job, it will be the worst
the nth job's response time = (n-1) * q
the average response time = (n-1)*q/2
